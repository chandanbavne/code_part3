#write a program which contains one class named as BankAccount
#that class contains one class variable as ROI which is initialise to 10.5.
#BankAccount class contains two instance variables as Name and Amount
#Inside init method initialise all name and amount variables by accepting the values from user
#there are four instance methods inside class as Display(),Deposit(),Withdraw(),CalculateIntrest()
#Deposit()method will accept the amount from user and add that value in class instance variable amount
#withdraw() method will accept amount to be withdrawn from user and subtract that amount from class variable amount
#CalculateIntrest()method calculate the instrest based on amount by considering rate of intrest which is class variable as ROI
#Display()methdo will display value of all variable as Name and Amount
#create object
